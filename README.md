# OFFICIAL PROJECTS TO GET HYPED ABOUT

Crankin's Time Travel Adventure by uvula studio/Panic (led by Keita Takahashi): Fully complete and confirmed for Season I… but no fan can see it yet.

Description (unofficial): Use the crank to move time and do your best not to 
be suplexed into the ground by your enraged girlfriend.

Similar Games: he’s better known as the author of KATAMARI DAMACY, which is worth a play for the music alone, and Noby Noby Boy. The studio’s work is bizarre, including ALPHABET, “a slapstick marathon party game”, and TENYA WANYA TEENS, which is too strange to read some blogger’s opinion on.

BENETT FODDY'S ZIPPER by bennett foddy: Definitely complete and confirmed for Season One

Description (speculative): Who knows? Bennet Foddy’s work is varied- but is known for surreal control schemes and blisteringly brutal difficulty curves.

Similar Games: Getting Over It, QWOP, CLOP, SPORTSFRIENDS’ Pole Position. Enough said.

DOOM FOR PLAYDATE by @NickMagnier (Twitter): DAMN IT WHY (but complete regardless)

Description (borderline confirmed): Shoot creepos and crank to chaingun in the latest universal time waster for humanity that runs on potatoes for some reason.
Similar Games: Doom, probably something else but his Twitter is a mess of retweets

JEWEL MATCH SOKOBAN by @dovuro (Twitter): done?

Description (unofficial): A crank-free, lucious little 1bit sokoban with a unique mechanic.

Similar Games: Sokoban
